# ESPNow-Node-Network-Example
This is my first ESPNow Node Network Example, using a many-to-many configuration for ESP32s and ESP8266s (Sonoffs too) with a WiFi-Gateway including a simple WebPage console-like UI. The example connects multiple ESP32s and ESP8266s (tested w/ all seven I had available) to synchronously blink the LED_BUILTIN lamp, on/off, on all ESPs by any node, last change persisting.

...more to come.
